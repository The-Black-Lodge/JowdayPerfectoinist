# FAQ
## Is this safe to use on my main save?
Most likely. But, when using any mods I'd recommend backing up your save directory *just in case*. In Windows, this will typically be in `C:/Users/<YourUserame>/Saved Games/Hades II`.

## What happens to my save if I uninstall the mod with Perfect boons equipped?
Perfect rarity already exists in game, although not fully implemented. So, your save should still load. Equipped boons are still usable and retain their higher stats, but may look a little weird. Ending your run via victory/death/giving up will clear them out.

## What happens if SGG fully implements Perfect rarity at some point?
This mod will be marked as deprecated, and we will be able to enjoy a native Perfect experience!

## Why is everything so overpowered?
That's the point. This wasn't made with balance in mind! Try a few different configurations and see if you like it. Have fun!
### Config Suggestions
#### Upgrade Only
Check off the *Allow Heroic boons to upgrade to Perfect (Sacrifice)* box and set the *% Perfect* slider to 0. You'll only see Perfect when upgrading from Heroic. Adjust the *% Sacrifice* slider to further customize.
#### Ultra Rare
Uncheck the *Allow Heroic boons to upgrade to Perfect (Sacrifice)* box and set the slider to 1%. This prevents your boons from upgrading to Perfect, and you may or may not see a Perfect during your run.
#### Need More Power
Check off the *Allow Heroic boons to upgrade to Perfect (Sacrifice)* box and set the slider to max (default max is 10%).
### Give Me All The Power
The *% Perfect* max is configurable from r2modman (alternatively - modify the `MaxPerfectChance` value in `Ship/ReturnOfModding/config/Jowday-Perfectoinist.cfg`). The original intent was for a max of 10%, but feel free to increase it!
